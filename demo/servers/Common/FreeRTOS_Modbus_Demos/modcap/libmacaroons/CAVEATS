This file describes the informally standardized predicates recognized by the
libmacaroons library.  It includes individual caveats, whose format looks like
HTTP or mail headers whose purpose must not be overridden; and, header prefixes,
which provide a space for caveat frameworks to develop and experiment without
collision.

If you're looking to develop your own macaroons framework, and wish to alert
others to your chosen namespace, submit a pull request with your namespace
included.  This will informally serve to track all independent macaroon caveat
frameworks so that users can cooperate to avoid collision.

Headers
=======

expires
-------

The expires header dictates the UTC time after which a macaroon will no longer
be considered valid.  In the strftime terminology, the expires header looks like
this:

    expires: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
